# Student Database Analysis Project

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student data using **Python, R, and SQLite3**. It demonstrates end-to-end data workflows including cleaning, preprocessing, database management, and visualization.

# Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **R Programming** (comparative analysis)
- **SQLite3** (database management)

# Features
- Data cleaning (handling missing values & duplicates)
- Enrichment of dataset with new fields (Course, Marks)
- Conversion of CSV files to SQLite database
- Visualizations: Bar Charts, Line Graphs, Pie Charts, Histograms
- Cross-validation using R

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-abhishekraj8855/student-database-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder  
   ```bash
   cd student-database-analysis
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts in Jupyter Notebook or IDE  
4. Open the SQLite database to query student data  
5. Use R scripts for validation and comparative analysis  

# Learning Outcomes
- Improved data handling and preprocessing skills
- Practical knowledge of database management
- Data visualization and insight generation
- Confidence in applying both Python and R for analysis

# Future Work
- Apply machine learning models for performance prediction
- Automate data pipelines for large-scale datasets
